		The <a href="http://www.softcover.io" target="_blank">Softcover</a> publishing platform was designed mainly for ebooks like the <a href="http://railstutorial.org/book" target="_blank"><em>Ruby On Rails Tutorial</em> book</a> and <a href="http://learnenough.com/html" target="_blank"><em>Learn Enough HTML to be dangerous</em></a>, but it is also good for making more traditional books, such as the novel <em>Moby-Dick</em> by the Herman Melville (sometimes written as <em>Moby Dick</em>). We present below a short and affectionately irreverent book reprt on this classic of American literature.

				<em>Moby-Dick</em>
			</a>
			by Herman Melville begins with these immortal words:
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				<span>
					Call me Ishmael.
				</span>
				Some years ago never mind how long precisely having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, i thought i would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world, it is a way i have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation.
			</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			After driving off his spleen (which <em>can't</em> be good for you),
        Ishmael then goes on in much the same vein for approximately one
        jillion pages. The only thing bigger than Moby Dick (who—<em>spoiler
        alert!</em>—is a giant white whale) is the book itself.
