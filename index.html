		 HTML was created by the original "web developer", computer scientist
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim
      Berners-Lee</a>. It's not true that Sir Tim invented HTML in order to
      share pictures of his cat, but it would be cool if it were.

	<h2>Background</h2>
	<p>
		Learn enough to be dangerous is an outgrowth of the
		<a href="http://railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails tutorial</a> and the <a href="http://www.softcover.io">Softcover publishing platform</a>. This page is part of the sample site for <a href="http://learnenough.com/html-tutorial"><em>learn enough html to be dangerous</em></a>, which teaches the basics of <strong>H</strong>yper <strong>T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage, the universal language of the world wide web. Other related tutorials can be found at <a href="http://learnenough.com">learnenough.com</a>.

	</p>
	<h2>Founders</h2>
	<p>Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee
      Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical
      sophistication taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit
      at <em>least a <strong>billion</strong> people</em>, and probably more. To join our movement, <a href="http://learnenough.com/email">sign up for our official email list</a> now.</p>

		Michael is the creator of the <a href="http://railstutorial.org/">
      Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and principal author of the
      <a href="http://learnenough.com/">Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a>
      introductory sequence. He is an advanced student of
      <a href="http://kravmaga.com/">Krav Maga</a> and has a three-step
      plan for world domination. Rumors that he's secretly a supervillain
      are slightly exaggerated.

	When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes
      on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing
      interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the
      interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.

	You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy
      Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd
      at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a
      tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
